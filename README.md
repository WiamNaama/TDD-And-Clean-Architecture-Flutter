# TDD-And-Clean-Achitecture-Flutter:

This repo has a path for Tdd and clean architecture in Flutter.
I will use mainly the Reso coder tutorial and other resources like(videos, images, articles ..).

## Installation:

Just download the repo and you are good to go.

## Overview:

Here is the path and I will share useful links as I said until I finish the Reso coder course:

1. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [1] – Explanation & Project Structure.
2. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [2] – Entities & Use Cases.
3. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [3] – Domain Layer Refactoring.
4. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [4] – Data Layer Overview & Models.
5. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [5] – Contracts of Data Sources.
6. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [6] – Repository Implementation.
7. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [7] – Network Info.
8. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [8] – Local Data Source.


## Here are the details for each section:

### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [1] – Explanation & Project Structure:
 
#### Links:
 1. [Clean Architecture with Robert Martin a.k.a. Uncle Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekBWizEpyvo&t=965s&ab_channel=OtavioLemos).
 2. [Explanation & Project Structure](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/27/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-1-explanation-project-structure/).
 

###  Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [2] – Entities & Use Cases:

### Note:
   When you want to use mockito just follow these steps in order to work because of null safety:

 2. [Entities & Use Cases](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/29/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-2-entities-use-cases/).
 
 
 
###  Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [3] – Domain Layer Refactoring:
 
#### Links:
 1. [Domain Layer Refactoring](https://resocoder.com/2019/09/02/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-3-domain-layer-refactoring/).
 
 
### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [4] – Data Layer Overview & Models:

### Notes:
 1. Read about factory constructor in dart.
 2. Read about the fixture in testing and why we might need it.

#### Links:
 1. [Data Layer Overview & Models](https://resocoder.com/2019/09/09/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-4-data-layer-overview-models/).
 


### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [5] – Contracts of Data Sources:

#### Note:
1. Read about erver exceptions.
 
#### Links:
 1. [Contracts of Data Sources](https://resocoder.com/2019/09/12/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-5-contracts-of-data-sources/).


 
### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [6] – Repository Implementation:

#### Note:
1. Read about Typedef in dart.
 
#### Links:
 1. [Repository Implementation](https://resocoder.com/2019/09/19/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-6-repository-implementation/).


### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [7] – Network Info:

#### Note:
1. This note related to test file:
   Use the internet connection checker instead of the Data connection checker because it supports null safety.

 
#### Links:
 1. [Network Info](https://resocoder.com/2019/09/23/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-7-network-info/).


### Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [8] – Local Data Source:

#### Note:
