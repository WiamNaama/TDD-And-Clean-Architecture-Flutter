# TDD-And-Clean-Achitecture-Flutter:

This repo has a path for Tdd and clean architecture in Flutter.
I will use mainly the Reso coder tutorial and other resources like(videos, images, articles ..).

## Installation:

Just download the repo and you are good to go.

## Overview:

Here is the path and I will share useful links as I said until I finish the Reso coder course:

1. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [1] – Explanation & Project Structure.
2. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [2] – Entities & Use Cases.
3. Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course [3] – Domain Layer Refactoring.


## Here are the details for each section:
